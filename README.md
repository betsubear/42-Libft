# 42-Libft
Here are my functions for the 42 project Libft.
The project has benn graded 125, with the bonuses.

To compile and create the libft.a, just use the command 'make' in the folder.

_Note for later: I will try to have a cleaner folder architecture for this one, so the functions could be classified by usage._
